# Kyle Richardson

Hello there my name is Kyle Richardson. I've lived in the Seattle area for nearly 15 years and have been programming for nearly 8 years. While my previous focus has been in Java and C varients I'm very excited to get deep into the python progamming language.

## Other Hobbies
In addition to programming I'm also enjoy playing video and physical games, watching both versions of football, and acting. You can check out some of my acting work by visiting [my website.](http://www.KyleRichVA.com "KyleRichVA.com")
