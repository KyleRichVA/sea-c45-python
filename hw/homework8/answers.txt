Homework 8

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

part 1: The program fails and returns a name error as the variables that got commented out are both attempted to get called later on.
part 2: A simular name error as "gc_count" which is called is never created when adding this comment.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175
A nucleotides: 7701287
C nucleotides: 5879128
G nucleotides: 5738773
T nucleotides: 7661547


Problem 6:
 
The sum of the nucleotides does not match up with bp count and sequence count. The reason for this is that the letter N shows up in the sequences. It is counted into number of bps and the sequence length however it is not a part of the nucleotide sum. This did cause the GC/AT content to be incorrect.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:

moderate GC content
